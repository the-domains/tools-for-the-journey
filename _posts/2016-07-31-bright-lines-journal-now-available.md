# "Bright Lines Journal" now available!

### **<b\>Who should buy this book?</b\>**

This book is for you if:

\* You are frustrated with not reaching your goals, and truly want to succeed.

\* Goal setting systems, time management systems and planning systems don't meet your needs.

\* You keep commitments you make to yourself and others.

\* You can be clear about where you are, what you want to achieve, and the steps you need to do to get there.

\* You are creative and can follow guidance, while balancing it with independence.

**<b\>Who should not buy this book?</b\>**

This not the right book for you if:

\* You already have a system that works well for you, and you are not interested in exploring another powerful system.

\* You lack the self-discipline to make and keep commitments.

\* You are not strongly motivated to succeed.

\* You are too independent to accept guidance.

\* You cannot take responsibility for yourself, or work independently.

Have you ever struggled to reach a goal, only to quit, or to compromise on the goal? It's easy to do, and most people have done it --- usually many times. You are clearly not alone, and you may take solace in being part of a large group who failed to achieve their dreams, but do you really want to settle for mediocrity, or worse? Or, would you rather claim your birthright? Yes, your birthright! If you truly understood how powerful you are, you would absolutely know and understand that success is your birthright.

Can you imagine how you would feel if you had a system to make reaching your goals much more attainable? A system that you could use repeatedly throughout your life that would become easier, the more you used it? Success is made repeatable through systems. Ask any CEO of a billion dollar multi-national company, a pilot of a jumbo jet, a neurosurgeon, a counselor, a successful youth program leader, a highly skilled student, a black belt, or any other successful person in any field, and they will likely tell you the importance of having replicable systems. A well thought-out and well organized system serves two functions: it creates predictability, and it frees the person to use their most powerful cognitive processes and creative energy in the parts of the process that require unique actions. Thus, the CEO can deal with unexpected market or supply changes; the pilot can respond to weather and traffic issues, or inflight emergencies, etc. Even emergencies, such as those faced by pilots, doctors, and others, are covered by carefully designed and well practiced systems and procedures. It is a key to success.

This <b\>**Bright Lines Journal</b\>** contains a system that can do that for you. However, it is not a theory book. It is an interactive book based upon the latest information of neuroscience, and other disciplines. By following the steps in this journal, you will experience and learn the system that has helped many people over many decades achieve lasting success. It is a process that can change your life. This is a tool that can finally give you the freedom you seek.

Your success will take dedication to the process, along with a willingness to have fun. Your <b\>**Bright Lines Journal**</b\> will help you personalize your system so that your path to success becomes more play and less work. It will guide you to celebrate success on the path to your goal. It will help you understand why you stumble, and how to correct your system, all without self-judgement, so you continue to progress --- making a mistake just makes the system stronger and more resilient. The <b\>**Bright Lines Journal</b\>** guides you all the way.

Your future is coming, and you have the opportunity to create what you want. Will you take it? All you have to do is to change one thing, and it becomes easier to change the next, and the next, and.... What one thing would you like to change? What your will your life be like when you make that change, and all the changes that follow? Get your own <b\>**Bright Lines Journal</b\>**, and make the life you want.
